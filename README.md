Started with some mini projects where I will be adding small functionalities in each project.And also will be sharing the images and the gifs to give an idea about how the project works:wink:

When clicked on one of the images, it changes to active and it then expands with the CSS transition.

When clicked on the navigation icon, it rotates the entire website and brings back the navigation to the original place.
